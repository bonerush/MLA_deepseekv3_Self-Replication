# MLA_deepseekv3_Self-Replication
Self-Replication of MLA
# Introduction
The MLA file is my own rough implementation based on the paper and source code. The Pos file is my attempt at writing a positional encoding module, and MHA is the multi-head attention module I wrote earlier, all for the purpose of self-learning.  
# Environment setup
The latest version of PyTorch is sufficient. My CUDA version is 11.8, so feel free to adjust it according to your needs.  
- torch>=2.5.1+cu118  
- torchaudio>=2.5.1+cu118  
- torchvision>=0.20.1+cu118
